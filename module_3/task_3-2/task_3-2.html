      <li>1. In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?</li>
      <p>Yes, one can solve part 1, with one single for loop.

        I have shown this under the two-loop option, as this is the one I originally made before trying to make one loop.
        To do this you need a for loop and then two variables inside, one from 1- 10 and one from 10-1.</p>


      <li>2. In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
        Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of your answer.</li>

      <p>In Part 2, one can create an "infinite" loop within the while loop condition.
        An infinite loop is a loop that continues executing indefinitely unless it’s interrupted by an external force or a specific condition that breaks the loop.
        To create an infinite loop, one could set the while condition to true.
        By doing this the loop will run forever, unless it includes a break statement or another condition to exit the program.
        Another way of creating an infinite loop could be to set the secretNumber to a value outside the possible range of guesses.
        So, for example, if the program only generated numbers between 1- 100 and our secretNumber was set to 101, the loop would never find the correct number and would loop continuously. </p>


      <li>3. Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the number of guesses and the time it takes. 
        How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can the program perform other tasks concurrently?</li>

      <p>Computers can compute the answer extremely fast, as they process random guesses and comparisons in milliseconds.
        However, considering that the program relies on a random guessing approach, the number of attempts required to find the correct answer can vary affecting the total time taken.
        During the guessing process, the program can’t do other tasks until the loop is finished.
        Since JavaScript also is single-threaded, it can only execute one task at a time, causing any other task to wait until the guessing loop completes.</p>


      <li>4. Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops.
        Can we, for instance, change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not matter?</li>
      <p>While it would make more sense to have the outer loop iterate over the rows and the inner loop over the columns one could change the order of them.
        If one was to reverse the order, one would still be able to generate the same output, however one would need to adjust how one constructs the string. </p>
