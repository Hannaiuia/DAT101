      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>

      <p> When the wakeup-time is exactly 7, the condition in the program is met (true), and so it will print out “I can take the bus to school”.
        However, if you set the wake-up time to be 6 or 8, the condition will be false, 
        and because no “else” and “else if” statement is used, the program won’t print a message. </p>

      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>If the “if” condition is met for exactly 7, it will print as in the last task. 
        Now we also have an “else” statement, meaning that if the time is something other than 7, 
        the “else” block will be triggered and print “I have to take the car to school”. 
      </p>

      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>

      <p>The condition is met for 7 and will print "I can take the bus to school.
        The “else if” triggers if the wake-up time is exactly 8 and will print "I can take the train to school.
        And if the condition is neither 7 or 8, it will trigger the “else” statement and give you "I have to take the car to school. 
        Therefore, if the wake up time is 6, the program will tell you to take the car to school,
        even though you have better time than if you woke up at 7 or 8. 
        In theory one should therefore have made an if and else statements for earlier than 7 and later than 8 for it to make total sense.
      </p>
      
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
       <p>Zero is neither positive nor negative, meaning that most likely nothing will be printed when you get zero. 
        Therefore, I made an “else” condition for zero, so that when the number becomes zero, one will get an answer.  </p>
