      <li> 1. What is the difference between invoking and creating a function? </li>
      <p> Creating a function is the process of writing the code and instructions for what the function will do, in short defining the function.
         In contrast invoking a function, also more known as calling a function, is when the function is called upon, running the instructions so that the code within executes.  </p>

      <li>2. Explain the syntax regarding semicolons and code blocks. </li>
      <p>Semicolons (;) are used to terminate statements, signaling the end of a line of code.
         In general JavaScript uses a feature called Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI), which automatically inserts semicolons where they are missing, allowing code to run.
        However, it is good practice to remember to use semicolons and not rely on ASI, especially when writing code in strict mode. 
        Code blocks are a group of statements enclosed with curly braces{}. Theyâ€™re used to organize code and are commonly found in loops, function definitions and stand-alone scopes. Code blocks also make boundaries for variables like let and const, within the scope, making them confined here, and further ensuring structured logic in the program. 
        </p>

      <li>3. What happens when we try to store values from a function when it doesn't return any? </li>
      <p> When trying to store values from a function that does not return anything, the function will automatically return undefined.
        This happens because JavaScript will assume that it should return undefined by default.
        As a result, all variables assigned to the functions result will hold the value undefines as long as nothing is returned. </p>

      <li>4. How do we separate parameters from each other when creating a function? </li>
      <p> Parameters within a function are in JavaScript separated by commas.
          When therefore defining a function, the parameters are listed within parentheses and separated by commas.  </p>

      <li>5. Explain how parameter names are related during the invocation and creation of a function. </li>
      <p> During the creation of a function, the parameters are given specific names inside the paratheses, like labels, to show what kind of information the function will need.
         When calling the function, you give it arguments (the values) that match those parameters.
         For instance part 4, we have a function: calculateRectangle(width, height), where with and height are the parameters. 
         When the function is called, one gives it arguments (the values) that match the parameters, like calculateRectangle(1,5). 1 is assigned to width and 5 is assigned to height. 
         This way the parameter names are like placeholders and the arguments provided during the function call fill these placeholders (related by position). </p>

      <li> 6. Explain why a parameter is undefined when a function call is missing a parameter. </li>
      <p> This is because JavaScript does not throw an error if a function call is missing an argument.
        Therefore, when a parameter is missing, it will just automatically leave the parameter as undefined. </p>

      <li>7. Explain what happens when we use recursive functions. </li>
      <p> A recursive function is a function that calls upon itself to solve a problem. 
        A recursive function will call upon itself and continue until it hits base case/meets the condition set.
        If there is no base case the function will continue to call itself indefinitely and can lead to a stack of overflow errors.
        We find an example of a recursive function in task 10. The recursion stops at base case when n is 0 or 1, the function will then return 1.
        The recursive case happens as long as n is greater than 1, and the function will then call itself with n-1 and multiply the result by n.
        This process will repeat until the base case is reached. </p>
