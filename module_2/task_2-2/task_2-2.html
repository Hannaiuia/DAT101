      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
        “const” is used to declare variables that should not change. 
        It is therefore ideal for constants, fixed configurations or references to objects and arrays that won’t be reassigned. 
        “let”, on the other hand, is used for variables that need to be updated or modified, as it allows for reassignment.
        With that said, all variables can therefore not be constants.
        If a value is supposed to change like in a loop, or a user input, one must use “let”, considering “const” will result in an error.

      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
	Parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression by determining the order in which calculations are carried out first.
        By default, arithmetic operations follow a specific order to determine which operations are calculated first, this is also known as “PEMDAS” (Parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction).
        Parentheses have the highest precedence, and so by using parentheses it allows you to control the order of operations, overriding the default rules.
        In task 1 we experimented with this - without the parentheses it gave us another answer then with the parentheses.

      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
	There are many ways in JavaScript of limiting floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals. 
        One way is to use “toFixed”, this (…) is used to format a number as a string with a specified number of decimal places. 
        Another example is “Math.round”, that one can use to get a number rounded to a specific number of decimal places. 
        Depending on what result you need, whether it be a string or a number and the level of rounding, each method has its own use.

      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
	Comparing two floating-point values to see if they are equal can be a bit tricky, especially when the number looks similar. 
        Instead of therefore asking the computer: “are the numbers exactly the same”, we can ask “are these numbers close enough to be considered the same?”.
        To do this we use a tolerance called “epsilon” for comparison. 
        Epsilon is a small number that represents the acceptable difference between the two numbers (you decide on the value). 
			</p>

      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
	Comparison operators return a Boolean value, either true or false. 
        This is used in programming to compare two values and check if the comparison is correct or not. 
        There are two ways to check if a comparison operator is true or false. 
        One can use it in a conditional statement, like an “if” statement, or by direct evaluation.
			</p>

      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
	The function Math.random() is a tool used to generate a “random” (pseudo) number.
        In general, its used to create random values within a range, selecting random elements or simulating randomness in games and so on. 
			</p>

      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
	The modulus operator gives the remainder of the division between two numbers.
        It is used for different situations to, for instance check if a number is even or odd, and determining factors and multiples. 
        The operator is therefore helpful when one needs to perform operations that involve remainders or periodic patterns.
